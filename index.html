      As the tech industry continues its rapid expansion, inclusion of women and individuals of color lags behind. At Rutgers,
      it's important to us to be part of the solution.

      This fall, we've launched #RUniteCS, a volunteer outreach program to spark interest in computer science in middle school
      students - because once they hit high school, STEM's appeal plummets dramatically. In what we've termed "virtual classroom
      visits," passionate and talented undergrads host a video panel discussion where kids can learn how we got interested
      in tech and the many directions a career in CS can follow. We tell them about our favorite, often silly coding projects,
      and point them toward free resources they can use to get started. We make every effort to have a diverse group of panelists
      of each discussion, because we feel it's important to show these students someone in whom they can see themselves.
      Visits can range anywhere from ten minutes to a whole class period - classroom time is valuable, so it's always up
      to teachers to decide how much they'd like to use with us.
