    As the tech industry continues its rapid expansion, inclusion of women and individuals of color lags behind. At
    Rutgers,
    it's important to us to be part of the solution.

  <p class="mt-3 has-links">
    This fall, we've launched <a class="inline-link" href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=@rutgers_usacs%20This%20is%20why%20we%20want%20a%20virtual%20classroom%20visit%20at%20our%20school!&hashtags=RUniteCS">#RUniteCS</a>,
    a volunteer outreach program to spark interest in computer science in middle school
    students - because once they hit high school, STEM's appeal plummets dramatically.
    <br />In what we've termed "virtual classroom
    visits," passionate and talented undergrads host a video panel discussion where kids can learn how we got
    interested
    in tech and the many directions a career in CS can follow. We tell them about our favorite, often silly coding
    projects,
    and point them toward free resources they can use to get started. We make every effort to have a diverse group of
    panelists
    of each discussion, because we feel it's important to show these students someone in whom they can see
    themselves. Visits
    can range anywhere from ten minutes to a whole class period - classroom time is valuable, so it's always up to
    teachers
    to decide how much they'd like to use with us.
