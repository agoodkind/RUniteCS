  bio: Hello, I'm Diane! I came to college with a spark of interest and no prior knowledge of Computer Science. I played endless computer games growing up, but had no idea what I wanted to do with my future; so I took a couple of "Is Comp Sci Right For Me?" quizzes and discovered an INEXHAUSTIBLE FIERY PASSION for Computer Science! I've found purpose, direction, a dream, and I want to share what Computer Science is to me in hopes that someone else will find their passion too. This summer I worked as an Application Developer Co -Op at UPS, implementing and enhancing new features for the UPS Chat Bot on multiple platforms. In my free time I like to watch movies, read books, play board games, video games, and attempt to cook and bake!

  bio: "Hey, I'm Alex. I've had a deep interest in how things work, and why they work that way. Because Computer Science is a relatively new field, the vast depth of knowledge that is available to learn is infinitely growing. I chose CS because I can always continue to learn, and have oppourtunities to create something new!"

  bio: "I interned at Igolgi Inc. as a Cloud Deployment Engineer where I developed an auto-scale backend system using Microsoft Azure to deploy their media transcoding application. That was probably the coolest project I've ever worked on. In the future, I wish to expand my portfolio by interning at a variety of companies that provide elegant solutions to different fields of the tech industry in order to find my true calling. Eventually, I hope to have my very own startup. My interest in tech originated from my parents' unwillingness of letting me touch our first home computer and my persistence in finding alternative forms of entertainment other than handheld consoles at the age eight.
