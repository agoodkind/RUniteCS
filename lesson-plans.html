<p><strong>Title: Rutgers University Virtual Classroom Visit: Q&amp;A with Undergraduate Computer
		Scientists</strong></p>
<p><strong>Lesson Objectives:</strong>
	<em>By the end of the lesson, students will be able to:</em></p>
<p><em>-</em> Better understand both the challenges and excitement of the technology industry</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		<p>Discuss the lack of diversity in the tech sphere and the need to increase it</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p>Cite examples demonstrating the use of technological knowledge as a tool for a wide array of
			interests</p>
	</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Teaching/Instructional Method:</strong></p>
<p><strong>-</strong> Students will join a Google Hangout session with a 2-3 person panel of undergraduate
	computer science major from Rutgers University</p>
<p><strong>Instructional Materials and Resources needed</strong></p>
<ul>
	<li>
		<p>projector and screen</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p>reliable WiFi connection</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p>HDMI cable</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p>Google Hangouts/Skype permissions on school network</p>

</ul>
<p><strong>Warm-Up</strong> / Anticipatory Set</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		<p>Before the Virtual Classroom Visit, students will have filled out the anonymous pre-panel
			survey detailing demographic information and initial interest and knowledge of the tech
			industry
			▪ Survey can be found here: https://docs.google.com/forms/u/1/d/
			1exM9c2OoGhnNIqHEYzq2qujs8yFcMX1U0Orm2SbY5i8/edit?
			usp=sharing</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p>Students will have prepared 1-3 questions each to ask the panelists. Sample questions
			might include:
			▪ What does a day in the life of a programmer look like?
			▪ Is coding as difficult as it looks?
			▪ Why is it important to be tech-literate if I’m not interested in working in
			the technology sector?</p>
	</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Phase I: Presentation</strong> (00:00 - 00:15)</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		<p>Panelists initially will <strong>not</strong> have video enabled</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p>Panelists will ask students what the class thinks they look like.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p>Students will describe both physical and personality attributes of a technologist to panelists</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				<p>Panelists may prompt students for certain traits</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						<p>What gender am I?</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>What race am I?</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>How old am I?</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>How long have I been programming?</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>What do I do other than coding?</p>
					</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p>Once the sketch is finished, panelists will enable video and introduce themselves - name, class
			year, and how they first got into coding , and discuss with students how accurate or inaccurate
			their initial conceptions were</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				<p>Panelists and students will discuss media and societal influence on who goes into tech</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						<p>Silicon Valley television show</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>Hidden Figures movie</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>Marketing for children’s toys</p>
					</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>Students will be invited to share with panelists and classmates why they may not be interested in coding or
					technology</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						<p>In response, panelists will discuss their own experiences with the student’s challenges or hesitation, and
							correct misconceptions if applicable</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>Panelists and students will discuss the urgent need for diversity in the tech sphere, and provide examples of
							the benefits of a diverse workforce</p>
						<ul>
							<li>
								<p>Data Mining (Machine-Learning generated ads which prey on specific demographics</p>
							</li>
							<li>
								<p>Product viability (new iPhones are too large for women to use comfortably)</p>
							</li>
							<li>
								<p>Thought diversity (effects of groupthink)</p>
							</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Phase II - Guided Practice &amp; Collaboration</strong> (00:15 - 00:35)</p>
<p><em>-</em> Q &amp; A : students will be invited to ask the questions they prepared for the panelists</p>
<ul>
	<li>Panelists will share their experiences in the industry and provide examples of tech giants who don’t fit the mold</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Phase III – Assessment (To be completed after the VCV)</strong></p>
<ul>
	<li>
		<p>Students will fill out the anonymous post-panel survey after the call, reflecting upon their changes in perception
			(or lack there of) of the tech industry</p>
