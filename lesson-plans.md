## LESSON PLAN

**Title: Rutgers University Virtual Classroom Visit: Q&A with Undergraduate Computer
Scientists**

**Lesson Objectives:**
_By the end of the lesson, students will be able to:_

_-_ Better understand both the challenges and excitement of the technology industry
- Discuss the lack of diversity in the tech sphere and the need to increase it
  
- Cite examples demonstrating the use of technological knowledge as a tool for a wide array of
interests

**Teaching/Instructional Method:**

**-** Students will join a Google Hangout session with a 2-3 person panel of undergraduate
computer science major from Rutgers University

**Instructional Materials and Resources needed**

 - projector and screen

- reliable WiFi connection

- HDMI cable

- Google Hangouts/Skype permissions on school network

**Warm-Up** / Anticipatory Set

- Before the Virtual Classroom Visit, students will have filled out the anonymous pre-panel
    survey detailing demographic information and initial interest and knowledge of the tech
    industry
       ▪ Survey can be found here: https://docs.google.com/forms/u/1/d/

          usp=sharing
       
- Students will have prepared 1-3 questions each to ask the panelists. Sample questions
    might include:
       ▪ What does a day in the life of a programmer look like?
       ▪ Is coding as difficult as it looks?
       ▪ Why is it important to be tech-literate if I’m not interested in working in
          the technology sector?

**Phase I: Presentation** (00:00 - 00:15)

- Panelists initially will **not** have video enabled

- Panelists will ask students what the class thinks they look like.

- Students will describe both physical and personality attributes of a technologist to panelists

    - Panelists may prompt students for certain traits

        - What gender am I?

        - What race am I?

        - How old am I?

        - How long have I been programming?

        - What do I do other than coding?

- Once the sketch is finished, panelists will enable video and introduce themselves - name, class
year, and how they first got into coding , and discuss with students how accurate or inaccurate
their initial conceptions were

    - Panelists and students will discuss media and societal influence on who goes into tech

        - Silicon Valley television show

        - Hidden Figures movie

        - Marketing for children’s toys

    - Students will be invited to share with panelists and classmates why they may not be interested in coding or technology

        - In response, panelists will discuss their own experiences with the student’s challenges or hesitation, and correct misconceptions if applicable

        - Panelists and students will discuss the urgent need for diversity in the tech sphere, and provide examples of the benefits of a diverse workforce 
            - Data Mining (Machine-Learning generated ads which prey on specific demographics
  
            - Product viability (new iPhones are too large for women to use comfortably)

            - Thought diversity (effects of groupthink)

**Phase II - Guided Practice & Collaboration** (00:15 - 00:35)

_-_ Q & A : students will be invited to ask the questions they prepared for the panelists
    
- Panelists will share their experiences in the industry and provide examples of tech giants who don’t fit the mold


**Phase III – Assessment (To be completed after the VCV)**

- Students will fill out the anonymous post-panel survey after the call, reflecting upon their changes in perception (or lack there of) of the tech industry

    - Survey can be found here: [https://docs.google.com/forms/u/0/d/1eyg31jSojF68418eOje8Kd9_w2OoQORsoYF8cnQptn8/edit?usp=forms_home&ths=true]([https://docs.google.com/forms/u/0/d/1eyg31jSojF68418eOje8Kd9_w2OoQORsoYF8cnQptn8/edit?usp=forms_home&ths=true)

**Wrap-Up / Review and Connections** (00:35 - 00:40)

- Panelists will point students toward free resources they can utilize if they’re interested in learning more or learning to code
